# phone-parser
A phone parser app that search for list of phone numbers, apply format and sorts them.

![Python application](https://github.com/accexs/phone-parser/workflows/Python%20application/badge.svg)

In order to test just double check the config file and run the main.py python file. One the tests directory there is a 
sandbox directory with mock data to play around.

A requirements.txt file is included but is used mostly for test dependencies.

### TODO
- Simple module to log (to files and terminal) so all prints can be removed.
- Worker helper module in order to use multi threading and increase performance on
 I/O tasks (reading the files) with Thread or ThreadPoolExecutor modules.
